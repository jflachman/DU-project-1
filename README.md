## Project Ideation:

### Idea 1:  US Weather Analysis

**Analysis results:**  What is the typical weather and weather extremes across the U.S.  

Pull in weather data for a year and determine the number of days in each temperature range.  Candidate temperature ranges would be bins (-30..120 in 5 degree increments).  Collate and plot the results by zip code or county (we will pick one).

#### Step 1: Pull in and organize weather data by weather station

- Import file
- Combine all station information
- Read station lat lon
- Add to combined df
- Read station name
- Add to combined df
- Save results

#### Step 2: Take station information and combine for zip code or county

**Note** zip code may provide finer granularity for plotting.  Consider creating and saving two datasets (stations aggregated by county and stations aggregated by zipcode)

- Query for county or zip code 
- Add to combined df
- Process all counties or zip and combine / average all data (high, low, precip)
- Save results


#### Step 3: Bin the temperature

Goal: How many days of year in each temperature range

- Create bins for highs (50-55, 55-6, â€¦. 95-100, 100-105) etc
- Create bins for lows
- Save results

#### Step 4: Create maps for each temperature bin

- Determine how to use shape files from US census, color code and import into mapping program
    - Options:  
        1. [google maps]
        2. [plotly maps](https://plotly.com/python/county-choropleth/#the-entire-usa)
- Create map for each temperature range 

#### Step 5: Consider creating a movie showing the progression of temps across maps

- Create movie or possibly a presentation with each map slide transitioning to the next every few seconds.

    - Plotly: Looks pretty simple
        - [Example](https://plotly.com/python/county-choropleth/#simple-example)
        - May need to determine plotly code for each county and merge into dataframes in Step 2 above
